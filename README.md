# AMHa_code
Code used in the AMHa paper

!No data is included!

Code used to extract required data can be found in the wrangling folder. Note that access to the FHS cohort and Social Network is required. 
The specific data files necessary can be found in the file import_clinical_datasets.

The folder analysis contains code used to obtain the descriptive analysis (Chapter 3.3, 4.1), while simulations give the calibrated model and the code to run the simulations found in Chapter 4.2.
